## Package.json and Build Setup Analysis

### Current Build Setup and Scripts
- The project uses **esbuild** for bundling the TypeScript code into a single JavaScript file
- Build command: `esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --platform=node --target=node18 --outfile=dist/index.js`
- The build creates a single bundled file at `dist/index.js` with no sourcemaps
- TypeScript is used for development but not for generating declaration files

### Current Package Exports
- `main`: Points to `dist/index.js` (the bundled output)
- `bin`: Exposes `lsp-cli` as a CLI command
- No `exports` field for modern module resolution
- No `types` field for TypeScript declarations

### Sourcemaps Status
- **NOT currently being generated** - the esbuild command doesn't include sourcemap flags

### TypeScript Configuration
- `tsconfig.json` is configured for CommonJS output
- `outDir` is set to `./dist` but TypeScript compilation isn't used in the build
- Currently only used for type checking (`npm run typecheck`)

### What Needs to be Added
The package appears to be both a CLI tool and a library (exports multiple classes and types). To properly export sourcemaps and types for consumers:

1. **Generate TypeScript declaration files** (.d.ts files)
2. **Enable sourcemap generation** in the build process
3. **Update package.json exports** to include:
   - Types field pointing to declaration files
   - Proper exports field for module resolution
   - Include sourcemap files in the package

4. **Exported APIs that should be available to consumers:**
   - `LanguageClient` class
   - `ServerManager` class
   - `Logger` class
   - Various TypeScript interfaces and types
   - Utility functions

## Exported APIs and Types Analysis

### Currently Exported from src/index.ts
- Nothing is currently exported from `src/index.ts`. It's purely a CLI entry point that uses Commander.js to handle command-line arguments and execute the analysis.

### Types and Interfaces in src/types.ts
These types should be available to library consumers:
- `SupportedLanguage` - Type union for supported programming languages
- `Position` - Line and character position in a file
- `Range` - Start and end positions defining a range
- `Supertype` - Type information including name and type arguments
- `SymbolInfo` - Core type containing symbol information extracted from code
- `ToolchainCheckResult` - Result of toolchain availability check
- `ProjectFileCheckResult` - Result of project file detection
- `ServerConfig` - Configuration for LSP servers
- `LoggerOptions` - Options for the Logger class

### Classes and Functions That Could Be Useful as a Library
The following components would be valuable for programmatic use:

**Core Classes:**
- `LanguageClient` - Main class for interacting with LSP servers
- `ServerManager` - Manages LSP server installation and lifecycle
- `Logger` - Logging utility with structured output

**Utility Functions:**
- `checkToolchain()` - Verify if language toolchain is installed
- `checkProjectFiles()` - Check for project configuration files
- `getAllFiles()` - Recursively find files by extension
- `downloadFile()` - Download files with redirect handling
- `extractArchive()` - Extract zip/tar archives

### Current Usage Pattern
The codebase is currently **purely CLI-focused**. There's no existing library usage pattern. The main workflow is:
1. CLI parses arguments
2. Checks toolchain and project files
3. Ensures LSP server is installed
4. Creates LanguageClient instance
5. Analyzes directory and outputs JSON

To make this available as a library, the core functionality would need to be refactored to separate CLI concerns from the programmatic API, allowing consumers to:
- Programmatically analyze codebases
- Customize logging behavior
- Handle results in-memory instead of just file output
- Integrate LSP analysis into other tools
